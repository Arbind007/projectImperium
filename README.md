### **Summary**
>In a digital age, where all devices are connected to the internet, we have many devices in the market which helps us to control them from any part of the world. This is a great initiative to save electricity. But the problem lies in the commercialization of the products. The products, for example the Phillips Hue Smart Bulbs are very costly and also require an additional Hub, often the total cost of setup reaching about ₹12,000! Thus, we present to you our brainchild, “Imperium”, a versatile add-on to your switch board or distribution box to convert any plain old and boring electrical socket into an integrated IoT Smart Switchboard! Imperium is an add-on board that can be added to any electrical socket which will transform it to a smart electrical outlet. Imperium will use an Android app integration with a dedicated web server and thus will enable the user to control the power to the electrical sockets directly FROM ANY PART OF THE WORLD! A common question may come that why modify an electrical socket? The answer to this is that if we have the electrical socket modified directly then we can make any appliance a smart appliance. Thus, we can practically control any device which is connected to our electrical socket, be it a microwave oven, a mixer grinder or even a TV. Now, the reason our product stands out from the crowd is because of its cost factor. What we want is that our innovation must be accessible to the masses. That is why we have come up with a product which will cost 1/5th of the price of the currently available smart switchboards in the market, whereas not even sacrificing any of its functionality. Moreover, our add-on board is product independent. It can be used to control the power flow on any type of switch or distribution box! “Imperium” will help society move on to the next stage of automation by digitally controlling the electrical consumption. IT HELPS TO KEEP A CHECK ON THE POWER CONSUMPTION AND THE RISING CONCERN OF GLOBAL WARMING BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF NATURAL GAS USED IN ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATION.

### **How is PWM applicable to AC?**
> PWM in AC is done through Zero Crossing Dimmer Circuit. More on that [here](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-ac-light-dimmer-using-triac).
### **Future Prospects?**
* This prototype was able to control two LED lights via the open-source [Blynk App](https://blynk.io/) and [Blynk Server](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server).
* When mass produced, it will be one of it's kind at this price range in the market.
